# TeLoFunca

TeLoFunca was our end-of-year project during the second year of high school. It's essentially a copy of [Can You RUN It](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri), and the name is a play on words with "funcar," which means "works well" in Spanish (at least in Uruguay).

We couldn't use any database, so the data is in the folder `pagina2` in multiple JSON files (Like MongoDB but 1000 times worst).

You can download and test it. If you have Python installed, navigate to the project folder and run the command `python -m http.server` and go to `/pagina1/index.html`

Originally this project was in another git repository, but due to there was personal data I created a new repo.
